Solution of Cahn-Hillard equation using finite difference method in 2D.  Python 3


This was a simple numerical analysis project. I used explicit Euler and AB2 time integration methods and 
central difference scheme (5 point stencil) for space discretization.
Feel free to play with it. 
I would be great if you can implement some implicit schemes such as Keller Box or even simple Backward Euler.
